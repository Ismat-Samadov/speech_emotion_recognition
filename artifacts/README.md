# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains trained models and preprocessing objects for the Speech Emotion Recognition system.

## Files Included

### Models
- **speech_emotion_recognition_model.keras** - Final trained model (all epochs)
- **best_ser_model.keras** - Best performing model during training (saved by ModelCheckpoint)

### Preprocessing Objects
- **scaler.pkl** - StandardScaler for feature normalization
- **label_encoder.pkl** - LabelEncoder for emotion class mapping

### Metadata
- **model_metadata.json** - Model architecture and performance information

## Usage

### Loading the Model

```python
import pickle
from tensorflow import keras

# Load model
model = keras.models.load_model('artifacts/speech_emotion_recognition_model.keras')

# Load preprocessing objects
with open('artifacts/scaler.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

with open('artifacts/label_encoder.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    label_encoder = pickle.load(f)
```

### Making Predictions

```python
import librosa
import numpy as np

# Extract features from audio file
audio, sr = librosa.load('path/to/audio.wav', duration=3, sr=22050)
# ... extract features using the same method as training

# Scale features
features_scaled = scaler.transform(features.reshape(1, -1))

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(features_scaled)
emotion = label_encoder.inverse_transform([np.argmax(prediction)])[0]
```

## Model Information

- **Architecture**: Deep Neural Network (Sequential)
- **Layers**: 4 hidden layers (512 → 256 → 128 → 64)
- **Input Features**: 195 audio features
- **Output Classes**: 8 emotions (angry, calm, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise)
- **Test Accuracy**: ~64%

See `model_metadata.json` for detailed specifications.

## File Sizes

Model files are large (several MB) and are excluded from git by default. If deploying, ensure these files are included in your deployment package.
